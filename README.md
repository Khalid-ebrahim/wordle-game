## What are the programs do I use to make this game?

- **HTML** : I use HTML to create the boxes, keyboard and the title of the game.

- **CSS** : I use CSS to gives the game neat and organized form.

- **JavaScript** : I use JavaScript to make the conditions thats make the game work and this is the most important things to create a game.

## What I would like to add for this game in the future?

- Maybe the game will be more specific if I let the player use his own keyboard.
- I will create a dark and light modes to make the game more professional.
- I will let the letters flipped after the player press "Ent"
